sleepyLog is a sleep tracker, where any user can create an account and log their sleep along with some data on them (such as start/end time, quality, duration). 



## using sleepyLog

you can browse it at https://sleepylog-2c21ce22bd2f.herokuapp.com/, or by cloning this repo and doing the following:

```bash
  cd backend
  bundle install
  rails s
  cd ..
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

forget to generate a secret_key_base for your rails server at your peril
